RT Message Quick Jump
=====================

Request Tracker (https://bestpractical.com/rt) does a poor job of collapsing quoted text in emails (at least in version 4.0.6).

This Google Chrome extension adds keyboard shortcuts to quickly jump between email correspondence on the Ticket Display page.

The shortcuts are "control-shift-up" and "control-shift-down".

Tested on Chrome 44.0.2403.125 and RT 4.0.6.
