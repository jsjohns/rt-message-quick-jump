RT Message Quick Jump
=====================

This is a Google Chrome extension that adds keyboard shortcuts to quickly jump between email correspondence on a [Request Tracker (RT)](https://bestpractical.com/rt) Ticket Display page.

This is useful because RT (at least as of version 4.0.6) is not smart enough to properly collapse quoted text in emails.

The shortcuts are `control-shift-up` and `control-shift-down`.

It has been tested on Chrome 44.0.2403.125 and RT 4.0.6.

The extension is available in the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rt-messsage-quick-jump/jpojcckcbjfifhdpbhkalhdkflgkbjfp).

Why not make development completely self-contained via Vagrant VM?
